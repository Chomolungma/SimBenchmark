# Simbench 

## Overview 

Simbench is the project for benchmark of rigid body simulation with contacts.

The list of the simulators is as follows:

- RaiSim by Jemin Hwangbo, Dongho Kang et al.
- [Bullet Physics](http://bulletphysics.org/)  by Erwin Coumans
- [Open Dynamics Engine](http://www.ode.org/) by Russell Smith
- [Multi-Joint dynamics with Contact (a.k.a. MuJoCo)](http://mujoco.org/) by Emanuel Todorov
- [DART Sim](https://dartsim.github.io/)

## Test results

- [Rolling test](rolling/rolling.html) - friction model test
- [Bouncing test](bouncing/bouncing.html) - elastic/inelastic collision test
- [666 balls test](666/666.html) - hard contact constraint test
- Building test
- [ANYmal PD control test](anymal/anymal.html) - articulated system speed test
- ANYmal zero gravity test - articulated system momentum test 
- ANYmal free drop test - articulated system momentum test

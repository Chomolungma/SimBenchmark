<h1>What is ERP and CFM?</h1>

<p>
  ERP stands for Error Reduction Parameter that fixes position error after one simulation step. RaiSim, ODE and Bullet supports ERP. As ERP is set to non-zero value, simulation attempts to fix the position drift by applying additional force. This prevents inevitable position drift from contact solvers. For example, as ERP set to non-zero value, the penetration error is significantly reduced as the following figure.
</p>
<p>
  However, we set ERP to zero for most cases due to the following reasons:

  <ul>
    <li>Error correction algorithm is not based on physics and may lead to inaccurate simulation (plot1)</li>
    <li>In the most benchmark tests, we focused on the solution from contact solver. Since error correcting is post-process, there's no means of using it in the benchmark tests.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  CFM is the abbreviation of Constraint Force Mixing. If the CFM set to positive value, the hard-contact constraint is softened which means that the constraint is allowed to be violated in certain amount. This helps simulation to be more stable.
</p>

<p>
  In our benchmark tests, CFM value was always set to zero since we investigates hard-contact constraint violation of each simulators.
